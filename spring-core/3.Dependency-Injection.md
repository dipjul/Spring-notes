# Dependency Injection
## The dependency inversion principle:
The client delegates to calls to another object the responsibility of providing its dependencies

##  Example:
- Our Coach already provides daily workouts
- Now will also provide daily fortunes
  - New helper: FortuneService
  - This is a dependency
## Injection Types
- There are many types of injection with Spring
- Two most common types
  - Construction Injection
  - Setter Injection
- Will learn about "auto-wiring" in Annotations sections later

## Development Process - Construction Injection
1. Define the dependency interface and class
2. Create a constructor in your class for injections
3. Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file

### Step 1: Define the dependency interface and class

```java
// File: FortuneService.java
public interface FortuneService {
    public String getFortune(); 
}
```
```java
// File: HappyFortuneService.java
public class HappyFortuneService implements FortuneService {
    public String getFortune() {
        return "Today is your lucky day!";
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Create a constructor in your class for injections

```java
// File: BaseballCoach.java
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach {
    private FortuneService fortuneService;
    
    public BaseballCoach(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
        fortuneService = theFortuneService;
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Configuring the dependency injection in Spring config file
```xml
// File: applicationContext.xml
<bean id="myFortuneService" class="com.luv2code.springdemo.HappyFortuneService">
</bean>

<bean id="myCoach" class="com.luv2code.springdemo.BaseballCoach">
  <constructor-arg ref="myFortuneService" />
</bean>
```

### How Spring Process your Config File
#### Spring Framework
```java
HappyFortuneService myFortuneService = new HappyFortuneService();

BaseballCoach myCoach = new BaseballCoach(myFortuneService);
```

## Development Process - Setter Injection
1. Create setter method(s) in your class for injections
2. Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file

### Step 1: Create setter method(s) in your class for injections
```java
// File: CricketCoach.java
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  public CricketCoach() {
  }
  
  public void setFortuneService(FortuneService fortuneService) {
    this.fortuneService = fortuneService;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Configure the dependency injection in Spring config file
```xml
// File: applicationContext.xml
<bean id="myFortuneService"
  class="com.luv2code.springdemo.HappyFortuneService">
</bean>
<bean id="myCricketCoach"
    class="com.luv2code.springdemo.CricketCoach">
    <property name="fortuneService" ref="myFortuneService" />
</bean>
```

#### Call setter method on Java class 1
```xml
<property name="fortuneService" ref="myFortuneService" />
```
```java
public void setFortuneService(...)
```

#### Call setter method on Java class 2
```xml
<property name="bestAthlete" ref="..." />
```
```java
public void setBestAthlete(...)
```

## How Spring Process your Config File
```xml
<bean id="myFortuneService"
  class="com.luv2code.springdemo.HappyFortuneService">
</bean>
<bean id="myCricketCoach"
    class="com.luv2code.springdemo.CricketCoach">
    <property name="fortuneService" ref="myFortuneService" />
</bean>
```
### Spring Framework:
```java
HappyFortuneServie myFortuneService = new HappyFortuneService();

CricketCoach myCricketCoach = new CricketCoach();
myCricketCoach.setFortuneService(myFortuneService);
```

## Injecting Literal Values
### Development Process
1. Create setter method(s) in your class for injections
2. Configure the injection in Spring config file

### Step 1: Create setter method(s) in your class for injections
```java
// File: CricketCoach.java
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
  private String emailAddress;
  private String team;
  
  public void setEmailAddress(String emailAddress) ...
  public void setTeam(String team) ...
  
  ...
}
```

### Step 2: Configure the injection in Spring config file
```xml
//File: applicationContext.xml
<bean id="myCricketCoach"
    class="com.luv2code.springdemo.CricketCoach">
    <property name="fortuneService" ref="myFortuneService" />
  
    <property name="emailAddress" value="thebestcoach@luv2code.com" />
    <property name="team" value="Sunrisers Hyderabad" />
</bean>
```

## Injecting Literal Values
### Read from a Properties File
### Development Process
1. Create Properties File
2. Load Properties File in Spring config file
3. Reference values from Properties File

### Step 1: Create Properties File
```properties
// File: sport.properties
foo.email="myeasycoach@luv2code.com
foo.team=Royal Challengers Bangalore
```

### Step 2: Load Properties file in Spring config file
```xml
// File: applicationContext.xml
<context.property-placeholder location="classpath:sport.properties" />
```

### Step 3: Reference Values from Properties File
```xml
<bean id="myCricketCoach"
    class="com.luv2code.springdemo.CricketCoach">
    <property name="emailAddress" value="${foo.email}" />
  <property name="team" value="${foo.team}" />
</bean>
```
