# Annotations
## Spring Configuration with Annotations
### What are Java Annotations?
- Special labels/ markers added to Java classes
- Provide meta-data about the class
- Processed at compile time or run-time for special processing

### Annotation Example:
```java
public class TrackCoach implements Coach {
  @Override
  public String getDailyWorkout() {
    return "Rum a hard 5k"; 
  }
}
```

### Why Spring Configuration with Annotations?
- XML configuration can be verbose
- Configure your Spring beans with Annotations
- Annotations minimizes the XML configuration

### Scanning for Component Classes
- Spring will scan your Java classes for special annotations
- Automatically register the beans in the Spring container

### Development Process
1. Enable component scanning in Spring config file
2. Add the `@Component` Annotation to your Java classes
3. Retrieve bean from Spring container

#### Step 1: Enable compenent scanning in Spring config file
```xml
<beans ...>
  <context:component-scan base-package="com.luv2code.springdemo />
</beans>
```
#### Step 2: Add the `@Component` Annotation to your Java classes
```java
@Component("thatSillyCoach")
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  @Override
  public String getDailyWorkout() {
    return "Practice your backhand volley"; 
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Retrieve bean from Spring container
```java
Coach theCoach = context.getBean("theSillyCoach", Coach.class);
```
<hr>
## `@Components` - Default Bean ID

### Spring also supports Default Bean IDs
- Default bean id: the class name, <em>make first letter lower-case</em>
  
```java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
```

```java
// get the bean from spring container
Coach theCoach = context.getBean("tennisCoach", Coach.class);
```

## Spring Dependency Injection with Annotations and Autowiring

• Our Coach already provides daily workouts

• Now will also provide daily fortunes

  • New helper: FortuneService
  
  • This is a dependency
  
### What is Spring AutoWiring?

• For dependency injection, Spring can use auto wiring

• Spring will look for a class that matches the property 

  • matches by type: class or interface

• Spring will inject it automatically … hence it is autowired


### Autowiring Example 

• Injecting FortuneService into a Coach implementation

• Spring will scan @Components

• Any one implements FortuneService interface???

• If so, let’s inject them. For example: HappyFortuneService


### Autowiring Injection Types

• Constructor Injection

• Setter Injection

• Field Injections

### Development Process - Constructor Injection
1. Define the dependency interface and class
2. Create a constructor in your class for injections
3. Configure the dependency injection with `@Autowired` Annotation

#### Step 1: Define the dependency interface and class
```java
// File: FortuneService.java
public interface FortuneService {
  public String getFortune();
}
```
```java
// File: HappyFortuneService.java
@Component
public class HappyFortuneService implements FortuneService {
  public String getFortune() {
    return "Today is your lucky day!";
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create a constructor in your class for injections
```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  public TennisCoach(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
    fortuneService = theFortuneService;
  }

}
```

#### Step 3: Configure the dependency injection `@Autowired` annotation

```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  @Autowired
  public TennisCoach(FortuneService theFortuneService) {
    fortuneService = theFortuneService;
  }

}
```

### Development Process - Setter Injection
1. Create setter method(s) in your class for injections
2. Configure the dependency injection with `@Autowired` Annotation

#### Step 1: Create setter method(s) in your class for injections
```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  public TennisCoach() {
  }

  public void setFortuneService(FortuneService fortuneService) {
    this.fortuneService = fortuneService;
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure the dependency injection with `@Autowired` Annotation
```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  public TennisCoach() {
  }
  
  @Autowired
  public void setFortuneService(FortuneService fortuneService) {
    this.fortuneService = fortuneService;
  }
}
```

#### Inject dependencies by calling Any method on your class
- Simply give: `@Autowired`

```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  public TennisCoach() {
  }

  @Autowired
  public void doSomeCrazyStuff(FortuneService fortuneService) {
    this.fortuneService = fortuneService;
  }
}
```

### Development Process - Field Injection

Inject dependencies by setting field values on your class directly (even private fields)
- Accomplished by using Java Reflection

1. Configure the dependency injection with `@Autowired` Annotation
  - Applied directly to the field
  - No need for setter methods  

#### Step 1: Configure the dependency injection with `@Autowired` Annotation
```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  @Autowired
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  public TennisCoach() {
  }

  // no need for setter methods
}
```

##### Choose a style and Stay consistent in your project

## Annotation Autowiring and Qualifiers

### Autowiring
- Injecting FortuneService into Coach implementation
- Spring will scan @Components
- Any one implements FortuneService interface?
- If so, let's inject them ... oops which one?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20329508/132179946-1e54cc44-0ad1-4236-984f-e102e14a5f29.png)

<strong>We have a little problem ...</strong>
```
Error creating bean with name 'tennisCoach':
Injection of autowired dependencies failed

Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException:

No qualifying bean of type [com.luv2code.springdemo.FortuneService] is defined:
expected single matching bean out found 4:

databaseFortuneService,happyFortuneService,randomFortuneService,RESTFortuneService
```

##### Solution: Be specific! - `@Qualifier`
```java
// File: TennisCoach.java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {
  
  @Autowired
  @Qualifier("happyFortuneService")
  private FortuneService fortuneService;
  
  ...
}
```

- Can apply `@Qualifier` annotation to
  - Constructor injection
  - Setter injection methods
  - Field injection

<hr>
## Bean Scopes with annotations

- Default Scope: Singleton

<strong>Refresher: What Is a Singleton?</strong>
• Spring Container creates only one instance of the bean, by default

• It is cached in memory

• All requests for the bean 

• will return a SHARED reference to the SAME bean

### Explicitly Specify Bean Scope
```java
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

...
}
```
### Additional Spring Bean Scopes
|Scope | Description|
|------|------------|
|singleton | Create a single shared instance of the bean. Default scope.|
prototype | Creates a new bean instance for each container request.|
request | Scoped to an HTTP web request. Only used for web apps.|
session | Scoped to an HTTP web session. Only used for web apps.|
global-session | Scoped to a global HTTP web session. Only used for web apps.|

## Bean Lifecycle Methods - Annotations
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20329508/132204545-43fc9dad-bb99-4947-9c90-2d788e3b27f6.png)

### Bean Lifecycle Methods / Hooks

• You can add custom code during bean initialization

  • Calling custom business logic methods
  
  • Setting up handles to resources (db, sockets, file etc)
  
• You can add custom code during bean destruction

  • Calling custom business logic method
  
  • Clean up handles to resources (db, sockets, files etc)
  
#### Init: method configuration
```java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

  @PostConstruct
  public void doMyStartupStuff() {...}
...
}
```

#### Destroy: method configuration
```java
@Component
public class TennisCoach implements Coach {

  @PreDestroy
  public void doMyCleanupStuff() {...}
...
}
```

### Development Process
1. Define your methods for init and destroy
2. Add annotations: @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
